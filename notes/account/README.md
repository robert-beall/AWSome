## What is an AWS Account?
An AWS Account is a container for identities (users) and resources.

## Account Creation
To create an AWS account, you must provide the following three pieces of information:
* Username
* Email
* Payment Method

## Account Root User
Every AWS account has a unique root user with **full** control and access over the account.

The root user is created using the email provided during AWS account creation. The root user **cannot be limited**.

## [Identity and Access Management (IAM)](iam/README.md)
IAM lets you **create** users, groups and roles and **grant** full or limited privileges.
